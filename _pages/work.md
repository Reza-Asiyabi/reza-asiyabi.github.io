Assistant Researcher and PhD student at the University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest (UPB), [Research Center for Spatial Information (CEOSpaceTech)](http://ceospacetech.pub.ro/), Bucharest, Romania, in the frame of the [MENELAOS-NT](https://www.menelaos-nt.eu/) European Training Network (ETN) H2020-MSCA-ITN project. The MENELAOS-NT project applies novel technologies to realize multimodal – multi-sensor data fusion to optimally combine the information, delivered by different sensors (in-situ/remote, optical/non-optical) on different scales, with different resolutions, and with different reliability. My main focus in this project was development of various deep learning-based solutions for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data applications.
