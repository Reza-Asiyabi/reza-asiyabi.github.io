Assistant Reseracher and PhD student at the University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest (UPB), [Research Center for Spatial Information (CEOSpaceTech)](http://ceospacetech.pub.ro/), Bucharest, Romania, in the frame of the [MENELAOS-NT](https://www.menelaos-nt.eu/) European Training Network (ETN) H2020-MSCA-ITN project. The MENELAOS-NT project applies novel technologies to realize multimodal – multi sensor data fusion to optimally combine the information, delivered by different sensors (in-situ/remote, optical/non optical) on different scales, with different resolutions and with different reliability.
My main focus in this project was on the development of various deep learning-based solutions for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data applications.
