**Hi 👋, I'm Reza!** 
*I build AI systems that try to understand the world rather than just fit the data.* <span class="pull-right"> </span>

I’m a researcher at the University of Edinburgh working on interpretable, robust, and physics-aware AI. My focus is on designing machine-learning models that combine theory, data, and real-world constraints, an approach shaped by years of tackling the unique challenges of Earth Observation.

A lot of my recent work has been in geospatial AI: from land-cover analysis to estimating biomass from radar, and from geospatial MLLMs complex-valued neural data compression. working with noisy, physics-coupled data forced me to build models that go beyond pattern-recognition and actually reason about the underlying system.

I’m currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the School of GeoSciences, funded by the [UK National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO)](https://www.nceo.ac.uk/) and [UKRI SECO project](https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/seco-project/). My research focuses on domain-aware deep learning to understand radar–vegetation interactions; Essentially teaching AI to interpret forests through the lens of backscatter physics.

I’ve published across leading ML/AI and EO venues, won competitive fellowships, and built methods that bridge theoretical depth with practical impact.

Before Edinburgh, I completed a Marie Curie–funded PhD at the University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest as part of the [MENELAOS-NT project](https://www.menelaos-nt.eu/), developing complex-valued neural networks for SAR. I then joined Stanford University to work on the [Market Activity Index (MAI)](https://market-activity.net/), creating an remote sensing approach to detect local markets in low-income countries through high-resolution EO data.

I enjoy building systems that turn messy, real-world data into meaningful insight, whether in geospatial applications or broader AI problems, and I thrive in teams where different disciplines push each other forward.
