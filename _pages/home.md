**Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Reza!** *Welcome to my world ;)* <span class="pull-right"> </span>\
<span class="small-grey"><i class="fa-face-smile-wink" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Let's get to know eachother, shall we?</span> 

I am a researcher and a PhD student at the Research Center for Spatial Information (CEOSpaceTech) working on Artificial Intelligence and Deep Architectures for Earth Observation (more specifically, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data) applications. I specilized in remote sensing and Earth observation and the applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning, and Machine Learning in this field. My primary area of research revolves around developing innovative methods for processing complex-valued SAR data for various applications, from SAR raw data compression, to land cover classification and semantic information discovery.

Currently, I am working as an early-stage researcher in the European Training Network (ETN) H2020-MSCA-ITN [MENELAOS-NT](https://www.menelaos-nt.eu/) project. The project applies Novel Technologies to realize multimodal â€“ multi sensor data fusion to optimally combine the information delivered by different sensors (in-situ/remote, optical/non optical) on different scales, with different resolutions and with different reliability.

As a part of my work, I published several papers in top-tier conferences and journals in the field of remote sensing and Machine Learning. My research contributions have been widely recognized and have earned prestigious awards and accolades.

Prior to joining CEOSpaceTech, I completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Geodesy and Geomatics Engineering at the K.N. Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. I then pursued my Masterâ€™s degree in Remote sensing engineering, where I focused on developing machine learning algorithms for SAR data.

I enjoy communicating with the people from diverse backgrounds and working with multidisciplinary teams. I am an independent researcher and I value initiative, knowledge sharing, and good collaboration.

Please take a look at [some of my work](/work).
