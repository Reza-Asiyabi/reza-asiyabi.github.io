**Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Reza!** *Welcome to my world ;)* <span class="pull-right"> </span>\

Iâ€™m a researcher at the University of Edinburgh, working on Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning for Earth Observation. My focus is on making AI systems more interpretable, robust, and domain-aware, with applications ranging from Geospatial LLMS to SAR data compression, land cover classification and above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation.

Currently, Iâ€™m a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the School of GeoSciences, funded by the UK National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO) and the [SECO project](https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/seco-project/). My research develops novel deep learning algorithms to better understand radarâ€“vegetation interactions and how AGB influences SAR backscatter.

Along the way, Iâ€™ve published in top-tier journals and conferences in Remote Sensing and Machine Learning, receiving recognition through awards and fellowships.

Before Edinburgh, I completed my Marie Curieâ€“funded PhD at the University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest as part of the [MENELAOS-NT project](https://www.menelaos-nt.eu/), where I developed complex-valued deep architectures for SAR data. Afterwards, I worked at Stanford University on the Market Activity Index (MAI) project, designing a novel method to detect local markets in low-income countries using high-resolution EO data to assess economic activity from attendance patterns.

I love working with multidisciplinary teams, learning from diverse perspectives, and building AI systems that bridge cutting-edge methods with real-world impact.
